Bounding boxes in image processing  consist of 4 coodinates which further has 2 representations 

1. Bounding boxes are usually represented by either two coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). (x1,y1) is the top left and (x2,y2) is the bottom right
2. Either by one co-ordinate (x1, y1) and width (w) and height (h) of the bounding box.  (x1,y1) is the top left 

There are various formula available for the conversion 
Width = (X2 - X1)
Height = (Y2 - Y1)



x1,y1 is called xmin,ymin
x2 y2 is called xmax,ymax
